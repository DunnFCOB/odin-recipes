    <h3>Pan Fried Homemade Latkes</h3>
    <p>I know what you're thinking, "Oh he's about to go on a long winded spiel about his childhood memories, and it's going to take a lot of scrolling to get to the recipe I came here for." Well I'll spare you the details and just give you a little background on what these even are.</p>
    <p>A latke is a traditional Jewish potato pancake made out of, you guessed it, potatoes, instead of the fluffy buttermilk stuff you're probably used to. Growing up, any time we had a family gathering my aunt would make several plate fulls of Latkes and were always worth getting excited for.</p> 
    <p>They're surprisingly simple, yet if you look online for a recipe all you'll wind up with are burnt, hashbrown-style discs that don't even come close to what I grew up with. So with that out of the way, I'll stop rambling and get to what you really came here for.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>Indeterminate amounts of salt (about 1/2 tsp), pepper (around 1/4 tsp), and garlic powder (1/8-1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>Sour cream and/or applesauce for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the potatoes, onion, and egg in a food processor until the mixture is mostly uniform</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a bowl</li>
        <li>Add in the flour and seasonings</li>
        <li>Preheat a frying pan on the stove on medium heat, add oil if necessary to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Fry mixture in the pan using enough to make latkes that are 4-5 inches across</li>
        <li>Once the latkes are slightly crispy, remove from the pan and place on a paper towel overtop a plate to soak up any excess oil</li>
        <li>Serve with your choice of sour cream and applesauce</li>
    </ol>
